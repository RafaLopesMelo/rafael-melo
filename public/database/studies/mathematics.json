    "description": "Recently I've been dedicating time to improve my knowledge in mathematics. While I understand that this knowledge may not have immediate practical applications in everyday life, I believe it will be beneficial for enhancing my logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, it will be a first step to go deep into more advanced data structures and algorithms subjects.<br /> My primary resource for this learning is the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025\">\"Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science\"</a>.",

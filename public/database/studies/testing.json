    "description": "I've begun studying about testing in general, because, although I do test in my projects, I consider my knowledge in this area to be shallow. My goal with this study is to enhance the quality of my tests and to learn to properly utilize every type of test, particularly unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.<br /> My primary resource for this learning is the book <a href=\"https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-javascript-assertivo\">\"JavaScript Assertivo: Testes e qualidade de cÃ³digo em todas as camadas da aplicaÃ§Ã£o\"</a>.",
